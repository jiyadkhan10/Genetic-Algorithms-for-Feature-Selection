# Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection

# Course
AI2002 Artificial Intelligence <br />

# Goal
1. Implement a genetic algorithm to select the most impactful features in a dataset. <br />
2. Show the results of the feature selection and compare results without any feature selection. <br />
# Assignment Background and Motivation
Feature selection is a machine learning process where redundant and irrelevant features are removed from a dataset. Evolutionary algorithms including genetic algorithms have been successfully used for the purpose of feature selection. The selected features will often provide approximately as good, or better, results, and having data with less dimensions have a few advantages when training a predictive model: <br />
<br />
1. Faster training time <br />
2. Reducing overfitting <br />
3. Requiring less data entries <br />
<br />
In this project you are tasked with creating a genetic algorithm for finding the best features for a given dataset. The features will be passed to a simple machine learning algorithm which returns the accuracy. This accuracy can be used as a fitness score for the implementation of the genetic algorithm for this problem. The objective is to maximize the accuracy. <br />
